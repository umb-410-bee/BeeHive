## Jonathan Renan Esponilla

Hello I am Scrum Master Jonathan Renan Esponilla.
As the Scrum Master, I asked questions around to help keep things going, 
specifically when it came to permissions and management of our source directory.
I also helped communicate if there were some weird issues with specific features.


### Pre-Git Era

We were trying to figure out file paths and what each of us were going to do in the project.

I also was selected as Scrum Master here.

During the early days, I added my info_nnnn.txt file to the list of text files.
I also just created the "simlink" directory so we could place ours there.

I also discovered the deploy directory ```/home/hdeblois/public_html/cs410/f25/Bee/```, 
so we were finally able to get the website in a viewable state.
Viewing the url ```https://umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/index.html``` was our main method of testing the website.

Copying everything got annoying so I also made a bash script ```deploy.sh``` to help move everything.


### When we had Git

During Git testing, we each made our own branch, created a python script, pushed it in,
in which then one of us merged everything in the main branch. This functioned correctly.

Now that we learned Git, we deleted everything in the deploy directory to use "git clone" and "git pull".

I reported a "dubious ownership" error on ```git status```, and we weren't sure what was up with that so
we had to make a new "source" directory just so we could remake the git directory.

There was eventually an issue with pushing, so we had to move again.

Eventually we just gave up and, after communication with the client, moved on to using Github.
The permissions on the server were really weird, and we couldn't resolve it quickly enough
because someone else manages it, which is a major factor in moving to Github. 

I also started work on my site feature (a bee quiz) locally. 
This is because there were several permission errors with git: 
so many errors that we had to move directories twice (using the same bash script).

The bee quiz is simply a "yes or no" window that gives a response depending on your choice.


### When we had Github

Git was set up and we were all invited into an "Organization."

Once we got Github, I was able to integrate my site feature onto the website.
I initially placed the bee quiz in the home page,
but it turned out we were making a multi-page site,
so the quiz had to be moved to its own page.
Because of this, however, I decided to add a scrolling background.

The url is now "[umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/](https://umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/)"
Viewing this url is how we did tests for the overall site.
We have our own solutions for testing our individual branches
(I use a Live Preview plugin on VSCode)

During this time, I helped approve some merge requests.

I also deleted everything in the deploy directory (in the server) to use "git clone" and "git pull". Again.
This actually stopped working (I didn't have the correct permissions),
but we were allowed to just use the Github, as the client also had access to it.

I also worked on testing and started working on artifacts directory and their contents.
One of these is the ```README.md``` file you're reading now.
Another is ```done-done.txt```, a done done checklist that replicated our
"projects" tab in our github organization, a tab that let us track our individual progress.

The final artifact is ```log.txt```, a full history of everyone's commits during our time in using Github.
This is a majority of our progress in the website itself, so I think it's alright.
