## Jonathan Renan Esponilla

Hello I am Scrum Master Jonathan Renan Esponilla.
As the Scrum Master, I asked questions around to helpe keep things going, specifically when it came to permissions and management of our source directory.


### Pre-Git Era

We were trying to figure out file paths and what each of us were going to do in the project.

I also was selected as Scrum Master here.

During the early days, I added my info_nnnn.txt file to the list of text files.

I also discovered the deploy directory ```/home/hdeblois/public_html/cs410/f25/Bee/```.

Copying everything got annoying so I also made a bash script to help move everything.


### Git Era

Now that we learned Git, we deleted everything in the deploy directory to use "git clone" and "git pull"

I also started work on my site feature (a bee quiz) locally. This is because there were several permission errors with git: so many errors that we had to move directories twice (using the same bash script).


### Github Era

Once we got Github, I was able to integrate my site feature onto the website.

The url is now "[umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/](https://umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/)"

During this time, I helped approve some merge requests. I also finalized my bee quiz.

I also deleted everything in the deploy directory (in the server) to use "git clone" and "git pull". Again.

I also worked on testing and started working on artifacts directory and their contents.
