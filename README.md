Pre-Git

As assigned ProductOwner, I was tasked with managing communications between the client and group, Bee. As ProductOwner, to manage expectations, I created a list of agreements made by the developers to add to the website. This included creating a list of objectives for the group which includes creating ASCII art in the form of bees for each employee, the creation of a bee quiz, implementing a picture with eyes following the cursor, updating the cursor image to be a bee cartoon, adding in a navigation bar for multiple pages, and lastly, having an About me page for the corporation using Agile Development principles. 
The index.html file and DoneDoneChecklist were located under /hdeblois/public_html/cs410/f25/Bee and /courses/cs410/f25/hdeblois/GROUP/Bee. The website was tested live under https://www.cs.umb.edu/~hdeblois/cs410/f25/Bee/index.html. Then to address communication with the group, I created a discord for Bee and linked it to the discord for group Apple to faciliate communication. Additionally, I added the discord contact of the client and access to the main group chat for both corporations.

Git

To work on implementing Git, Ayden was most knowledgable about setting up the commands to clone a git and then created a tutorial for the group to push to the main branch. After dubious ownership permission issues, the client instructed to move files to /courses/cs410/f25/hdeblois/GROUP2/Bee. Then as ProductOwner, I helped to assign tasks where Jonathan was to create his Bee Quiz and then create a bash script to clone the files into the deployment path. Then Edward was to test the merge for the git directory and then Keertan implemented python scripts for further testing. Between them, they updated the Git to be called BeeHive.git to fix ownership issues. Then I created/uploaded a bee cursor and favicon. Mahdi was tasked to implement his navigation bar, and Ayden was tasked to finish working on his Javascript file for his moving cursor html page. After working 3 hours in working with the commands in Git and attempting to debug on my own, I came to the same conclusion that there were permission errors. So after talking to the client, we moved onto Github.

Github

After feedback from the client, the artifacts were moved onto Github via each individual group. With several tasks created and pushed, we completed working on the website which was deployed on:
https://umb-410-bee.github.io/BeeHive/

Mahdi: For this project, my main contribution was the navigation bar for the site. First and foremost, I ensured it was functional in allowing the user to access any of the 4 pages, home, about, beequiz, and canvas-guy, from any page they are on. Next was ensuring it aesthetically matched the page, giving it a yellow color scheme, with a slightly darker yellow that highlights whichever page the user is currently viewing, as well as another darker yellow for any of the buttons the user is hovering their mouse over, to add responsiveness to the users actions. I was also responsible for fixing some of the overall style issues and made sure the general format (margins, navbar size and border) was unified accross all pages.
